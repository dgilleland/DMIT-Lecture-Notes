# DMIT-0000 - Our First Class

Hello, and Welcome to **DMIT-0000** (_COURSE_NAME_)!!

My name is ***Dan Gilleland*** and I will be your instructor for this course. All our lecture times will be done through remote classrooms using Microsoft Teams. Our first class is set for **_TIME_** on **_DATE_*, and there are a few key things to keep in mind.

First, be sure to **click the RSVP link** in this (and future) emails to get access to the classes.

Second, download and install Microsoft Teams. You can [**install it on your desktop**](https://youtu.be/qx8xHpRMFHU) and [on your phone](https://youtu.be/gvCRIieb7NQ). I'm assuming you have a computer with Windows 10 installed, so just use the instructions in the following video (if not, please contact me by email - dgilleland@nait.ca).
