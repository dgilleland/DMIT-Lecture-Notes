# Recording Online Synchronous Sessions 

NAIT strongly recommends that instructors record all synchronous sessions to accommodate students who are unable to participate in those sessions for reasons such as time zones, bandwidth, and caregiver responsibilities. These recordings should be made available to students through NAIT supported classroom technologies (for example Moodle) which limits access to students registered in the course. Note that you may wish to pause the recording during student discussions if you are concerned that the recording may inhibit participation. 

Note: In cases where lectures are not recorded, individual accommodations may be necessary for students who are unable, for a valid reason (e.g., different time zones), to attend synchronous learning activities. 

To do when and if recording: 

- Remind students of their responsibility in ensuring that the video and associated material are not reproduced or placed in the public domain. 
- Remind students that recordings will be kept for one year, after which they will be deleted. 
- Students may not want to appear on video and may want to use audio only. Students should not be required to turn their video on unless there is rationale that has been clearly explained to students, for example formative assessment where feedback will be provided. Students cannot be penalized should they choose not to have their image recorded. 
- To meet FOIP requirements, instructors should use the following statement in their syllabus and Moodle site. This also allows students to discuss concerns privately with the instructor. 
- If the session is being recorded, students should be instructed regarding the expectations at the beginning of every class including the following statement:

## Critical statements to use when employing e-proctoring software

If an instructor has chosen to record an assessment using online proctoring software, it is a requirement to be explicit about how this recording will be used and how it will be stored. To meet FOIP requirements, it is critical that instructors provide the following statement(s) to students before the start of the assessment. This statement should also be included in the syllabus and Moodle site. 

## Exams with Live Monitoring
