# Academic Integrity (Sept 2020)

Message to Students:

Good afternoon,

You will see information regarding NAIT’s new Academic Integrity Training appearing in multiple places in your Student Portal.  We would like to take this opportunity to explain your responsibility and the purpose of the training.

**What is academic integrity and why is it important to me?**

Academic integrity refers to how you are expected to complete your academic work. This means that you will only submit work that is your own, that meets the expected parameters of the assignment, and work that is not your own is accurately attributed (NAIT Academic Integrity Procedure, 2017).

Acting with academic integrity is how your instructors will gauge your performance and progress and is important to support the development of your Knowledge Skills and Abilities (KSAs).

**I already know about academic integrity. Why do I need to complete this course?**

The purpose of the NAIT Academic Integrity Training is to set students up for success by providing a base foundation of knowledge and understanding with clear expectations regarding student academic integrity at NAIT.

**What if I do not complete this course?**

As a NAIT student, you have certain responsibilities which can be found in the Student Rights and Responsibilities policy (SR 1.0). One of those responsibilities is to ‘uphold the highest standards of academic and personal integrity, including avoiding all instances of cheating, plagiarism, or the falsification of documents, or statements’ (SR 1.0, 4.2.5). When you complete this course NAIT will know that you intend to meet this responsibility.

If you do not complete this course, it means that you have not met one of your key responsibilities. This can result in follow up from your program leadership.

**How do I access the course, and when do I have to complete it by?**

I have provided the link to self-enroll in the AI100 Academic Integrity Moodle course. It will also appear in multiple places in your Student Portal.  All students are expected to complete the NAIT Academic Integrity Training once per academic year and within two weeks of the term start date.

If you have any questions or concerns, or think you are unable to complete the training, please reply to this message.


On behalf of the Associate Deans Academic, Program Quality and Instructional Excellence Lead- CED, and Student Resolutions Office

Sincerely,

Steve Chattargoon
